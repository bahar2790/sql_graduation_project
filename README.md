Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and payment patterns. By examining various aspects of the data, we aim to identify opportunities for improving the e-commerce platform's performance and customer satisfaction.

Data

The dataset consists of several tables, including:

Orders: Contains information about individual orders, including timestamps, status, and customer IDs.
Customers: Includes details about customers, such as unique IDs, locations, and order history.
Products: Describes the products available on the platform, including categories and prices.
Payments: Contains data about payment transactions, including payment types and installments.
Reviews: Includes customer reviews and ratings for products.
The data is stored in a relational database, allowing for complex queries and analysis.

Queries

We have developed SQL queries to extract useful information from the dataset. These queries cover a wide range of topics, including:

Monthly order distribution
Order status breakdown by month
Top product categories during special occasions
Order counts by day of the week and day of the month
Analysis of orders by customer location
Identification of top-performing sellers based on delivery times
Analysis of payment methods and successful order counts
Categorization of orders based on payment installment counts
Data Visualization

We have created visualizations using Excel to present key findings from the data analysis. These visualizations include charts and graphs that help illustrate trends and patterns in the data. By visualizing the data, we can better understand customer behavior and identify areas for improvement.

Conclusion

Through this analysis, we have gained valuable insights into various aspects of e-commerce operations. By understanding customer preferences, sales trends, and payment patterns, we can make informed decisions to optimize the e-commerce platform and enhance customer satisfaction.
